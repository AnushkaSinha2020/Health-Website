            <h1>Why do we catch Dengue?</h1>
            <p>Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses. You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person. Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites.

                The two types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection.
                
                After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to the type of virus that infected you â€” but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. This means you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third or fourth time.</p>

            <h1>What can you dp to treat it?</h1>
            <p><h2>Prevent mosquito bites</h2>
                The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool on its own to reduce dengue fever in areas where the illness is common. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population are still the main methods for preventing the spread of dengue fever.
                
                If you live in or travel to an area where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of mosquito bites:
                
                <br><h2>Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing:</h2> The mosquitoes that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk, but they can also bite at night.
                <br><h2>Wear protective clothing:</h2> When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.
                <br><h2>Use mosquito repellent:</h2> Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it. For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of DEET.
                <br><h2>Reduce mosquito habitat:</h2> The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing water that can collect in such things as used automobile tires. You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs. At least once a week, empty and clean containers that hold standing water, such as planting containers, animal dishes and flower vases. Keep standing water containers covered between cleanings.</p>
