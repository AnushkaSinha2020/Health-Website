            <center><h1>Why do we catch cough?</h1></center>
            <p><h2>Viruses:</h2> Colds and the flu are the most common causes. While annoying, coughs that are “productive” get germy mucus out of your lungs when you're sick. Most will go away in a few days. After a cold, though, some "dry" coughs last weeks or months. 
                That could be because coughing irritates your lungs, which leads to more coughing, which irritates your lungs, and so on.<br>
                <h2>Allergies and asthma:</h2> If you have them, inhaling a trigger like mold can cause your lungs to overreact. They're trying to cough out what’s bothering them.<br>
                <h2>Irritants:</h2> Even if you're not allergic, things like cold air, cigarette smoke, or strong perfumes can set off a hacking spell.<br>
                <h2>Postnasal drip:</h2> When you're congested, mucus drips down from your nose into your throat and makes you cough. You can get postnasal drip from colds, flu, sinus infections, allergies, and other problems.<br>
                <h2>Acid reflux:</h2> When you have heartburn, stomach acids back up into your throat, especially at night. They can irritate your windpipe, vocal cords, and throat and make you cough.<br>
                <h2>COPD:</h2> This includes one or more of three separate serious conditions: Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive asthma. These illnesses weaken the tubes in your airway (bronchial tubes) and the tiny sacs (alveoli) that pass oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD.<br>
                <h2>Other causes:</h2> Many other problems -- lung inflammation, sleep apnea, and drug side effects -- can be triggers. Get coughs that won't go away checked out to make sure you don’t have a separate problem.</p>

            <center><h1>What Can You Do to Treat It?</h1></center>
<p><h2>Medicines:</h2> Over-the-counter cough remedies can help in a number of ways. Suppressants lessen your urge to cough. Expectorants thin mucus and make it easier to hack up.<br>
    <h2>Home remedies:</h2> You can drink warm fluids, inhale warm, moist air, and use cough drops. Add a spoonful of honey to hot tea, or choose a cough drop that has it. Never give honey to a child under a year old -- it can make them very sick.<br>
    <h2>Avoid triggers:</h2> If you have allergies or asthma, remove allergens from your home. Keep pets out of your bedroom. Use air conditioners to filter air during pollen season. You won’t see the effects right away, but if you stay away from what bothers you, you'll start to feel better.<br>
    <h2>Treatment for another problem:</h2> Coughs triggered by asthma, acid reflux, COPD, and other medical conditions need special treatment -- often medicine. Talk to your doctor.<br>
    <h2>Time:</h2> Common viruses are the most likely causes. Sometimes, the cough can last weeks or months after the virus is gone. Over time your airways will heal and the cough will stop.</p>
