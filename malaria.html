                <h1>Why do we catch Malaria?</h1>
                <p>Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.<br>

                    Mosquito transmission cycle
                    Uninfected mosquito. A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.
                    Transmission of parasite. If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.
                    In the liver. Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver â€” where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.
                    Into the bloodstream. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.
                    On to the next person. If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.
                    Other modes of transmission
                    Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:
                    
                    <br>1. From mother to unborn child<br>
                    2. Through blood transfusions<br>
                    3. By sharing needles used to inject drugs</p>

                <h1>What can you do to treat it?</h1>
                <p>If you live in or are traveling to an area where malaria is common, take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should:<br>
                    
                    1. Cover your skin. Wear pants and long-sleeved shirts. Tuck in your shirt, and tuck pant legs into socks.
                    <br>2. Apply insect repellent to skin. Use an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone. Do not use a spray directly on your face. Do not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.
                    <br>3. Apply repellent to clothing. Sprays containing permethrin are safe to apply to clothing.
                    <br>4. Sleep under a net. Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticides, such as permethrin, help prevent mosquito bites while you are sleeping.</p>
